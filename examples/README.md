To run the analysis in the paper simply run the following from this directory.

```console
$ bash run_all.sh
```

Note that this will take a very long time without a GPU.
The analysis was run on a single CPU core of a 64-core AMD Milan CPU and an NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPU in approximately two hours.
The parameter estimation analysis was run prior to this.
